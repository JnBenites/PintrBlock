# Pinterest Blocklist Repository

This is a repository that contains a list of filters that can be used to block the entire Pinterest website. If you want to prevent access to Pinterest for any reason, you can use this blocklist in your web browser to block the entire website.

## How to Use this Blocklist

You can access the blocklist via this link: [pinterest_blocker.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnbenites/PintrBlock/main/pinterest_blocker.txt).

To use the blocklist, you will need a website blocking extension in your web browser. If you don't already have one, here are some popular options to consider:

- [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation)

Once you have installed a website blocking extension in your web browser, copy the contents of the "pinterest_blocker.txt" file and add the filters to your list of blocked websites.
